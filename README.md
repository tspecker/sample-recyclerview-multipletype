# Sample RecyclerView with Multiple Types

This is an Android sample project that implement a "RecyclerView" with multiple type.

This "RecyclerView" implement the  "Super SLiM" library that allow to add "Sticky headers".

Also I try to add a "ViewPager" inside a row of the "RecyclerView" and currently, I face a bug with this implementing.
